Create a "Featured Products" Component

Use this component as a starting point: src/components/featured-products.tsx

Create an Agility Component Model for the content. Allow the user to choose which products show up using a search list box linked content field that is tied to the "Products" list container (meaning the Agility SDK will give me an array of products for that field on the component model).

Follow the patterns I've already setup in this project.

Do all the code work first and then create the Agility Component last, and let me see what you're doing before you create that component model.
